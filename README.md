# Timeboard
A web app for storing and displaying top times at events.

This web app is currently being developed in preparation for an event in mid-September.

Most of the functionality has been implemented (server logic, client-server communication, and displaying text on the client), with the current development focus now being on styling for the client UI. 

## Testing the site
Development on UI styling is ongoing, with some sections of the site having no styles applied to them. Buttons and links may appear as plain text, and text input fields may be invisible. These can still be clicked and used as normal.

To build and run the site locally:
```sh
npm i
npm run build

```

More to follow.
